      <h2>About Me</h2>

      <p>
        Hi, I’m <strong>Tanmay Singh</strong>, a Computer Science undergraduate with a strong
        passion for <strong>frontend development</strong>, <strong>AI</strong>, and building clean,
        user-centric digital solutions. I love working with technologies like <strong>React</strong>,
        <strong> Python</strong>, and <strong>SQL</strong> to turn ideas into intuitive,
        high-performance applications.
      </p>

      <p>
        Outside of academics, I’m a committed <strong>football player</strong> and athlete — a
        lifestyle that’s taught me discipline, strategic thinking, and resilience. I’m also actively
        involved in various <strong>technical and cultural student communities</strong>, where I
        enjoy collaborating, learning, and taking part in creative problem-solving.
      </p>

      <p>
        Whether on the field or in code, I’m always driven by curiosity, teamwork, and the desire
        to create meaningful impact.
